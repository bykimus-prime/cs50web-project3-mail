# cs50web-project3-mail

The goal of this project is to create a single-page app in the form of an email client. A user will be able to send mail, have access to a mailbox, view emails, archive/unarchive emails, and reply to emails.

The django web framework is used for this app, and I am most focused on using HTML and especially JavaScript to finish this project. I also make use of an API to handle the email system.
